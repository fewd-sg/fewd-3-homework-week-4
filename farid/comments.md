### Homework Comments
- Pretty cool that you tried out the `columns` property on the three sections below! Just want to point out that it's not fully supported across all browsers, so you will need a script like **modernizr** to check for browser support.

- I think it would be a better idea to simply set `padding-top` to your **spacer** div to push away from the fixed header, instead of doing it in 2 places - spacer and blurb.

- Responsive layout and menu ftw! Animated **form** div ftw!
