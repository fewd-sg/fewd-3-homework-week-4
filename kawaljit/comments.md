### Homework Comments
- To make your header sticky, simply add `position: fixed` and `top: 0` to your header div

- Add transitions to your links by using the `transition` property. You also have to create a `:hover` state for your links. Shall leave you to google this one :)

- It appears that you left out the switching of boxes using JavaScript! Will show you how to achieve this in class, do remind me!
