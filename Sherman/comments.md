### Homework Comments
- Here's some tips to fix the layout issues. Firstly modify the **.container** class to have `100% width` instead of `960px width`. Then modify **header** element to have both `left` and `right` properties to be 0. Try it and let me know how it goes!

- You can set `position: relative` on **.cover** so that the **.form** will be absolutely position within `.cover`. You can remove the `transform` and `margin` properties. Try this too!

- You can replace your email and password fields with `input` elements. I'll leave you to google this one.
